Heurisitc: more informed way to guess the "best" way.
	ex) for the maze, each node would have a priority, add to frontier based on priority

Best First Search: when you add each node to frontier, first assign a priority and then add to the frontier which is a priority Queue (Ordered best)

Maze Heuristics 
	-distance formula (euclidean)
	-manhattan (taxi-cab distance)

A* (actual algorithm used by self driving cars)
priority of Node n = cost to get to node n + estimated distance to goal
