Graph:	collection of nodes(vertices) and edges
	node--> holds stuff, edges--> connects nodes
	-connected component: two connected nodes
	-weighted graph: a cost or a weight associated w each of the edges
	-cycle: can travel in loop
	-directed graph: a direction associated w the way the graph moves from node to node
		--> can also have weighted directed graphs


Tree:	an acyclic graph with one node designated as the root
	either is empty or has more than one node, each node can have 0 or more children and one node is designated as the root
	-root
	-child/children
	-leaf: node w 0 children
	-siblings: node w the same parent
	-ancestors: any node on the path from the root
	-descendents: your childrens children etc
	-height: length of longest path from leaf to root
	-full tree: if every node has a leaf or four children
	-balance

---
Binary Trees: each node is a leaf or has 4 or more children
