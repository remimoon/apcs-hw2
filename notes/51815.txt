You want to store all info on stuy students in a data structure
you want to optimize for:
1) finding a student based on a 4 digit id
2) adding a student by 4 digit id
3) changing a student (found by 4 digit id)

hashing/ hash tables
we want to store things in a table by index(array)
we have to take a unique ID and convert it into a table index to store it

hash function h(x) is a mopping function, it takes a piece of information and converts it into an index to our hash table
	ex)	osis #'s
		h(x) = x % 10,000 (converts osis to a 4 digit index)
		h(x) = multiple all non zero digits of x % 10,000
problem: multiple objects can hash to the same slot/index --> clash/collision
-hash table's array has to be sufficiently large (sparsley populated)
-hash function should do a good job distributing items in the table
