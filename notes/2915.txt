RECURSION

public void printme (int n){
	if (n > 0) {
		printme (n-1);
		System.out.println (n);
	}
}

*is increasing, we know this because recursive function is above the println

basecase: where you stop and it's done --> ex) n=0
reduction (recursion) step: allows us to reach base case, modifies the variable
		--> ex) n-1

factorial
public int fact (int n){
	if (n==0){
		return 1;
	} else {
		return n * fact (n-1);
	}
}

getting out of a maze
	greek method:thesues (string)
	german method: hansel n gretel (bread crumbs)

	recursive
	base case-hit a wall, the end
	-need to put yourself in board

2/10
fundamental base algorithm for games which involes 2 independent entities

2/11
maze code, can also be called search code/path finding code
-blind search/ depth first search --> goes through a whole path before going back and trying another one if the first does not work

state space search
	state: the world, where you are
