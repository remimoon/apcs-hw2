*finding kth smallest
1) find smallest element in arraylist, remove, and do that k times and then find smallest 
--> time O(n^2)

2) sort arraylist, find kth 
--> time nlgn + k 

3) *****
   choose a pivot value, 
   partition the list (rearrange the list so on one side there are all the values higher than pivot value, the other side lower), 
   now pivot value is at its kth position, 
   if it's kth then thats the number, 
   if not just keep going

select (kth, List, startindex, stopindex
